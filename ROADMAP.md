<img src="media/icon_vault.png" align="left" height="128" width="128" />
The Ansible role vault contains all services for the installation, configuration, and management of HashiCorp Vault.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to installation and configuration, services are also available for storing and retrieving secrets.<br/>
<br/>

## Roadmap



**Export and Import of secrets**
The export_secrets service from a secret engine to a JSON file and import_secrets for vice-versa needs to be made more robust so that it is production-ready.<br/>
**PKI certificates**
PKI certificates can be stored and issued in the Vault.
